# BrainFort
Pure Fortran interpreter for BrainFuck

  Currently can interpreter simple programs such as the ones provided in this repo
  Can only interpret .bf files with one line. i.e the program has to be on 1 line only. see example files provided in repo

TODO:
    
    fix small bugs that don't allow hellhello.bf to run correctly
    Allow multi-line .bf files
